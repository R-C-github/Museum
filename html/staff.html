                    <p class="name">Dr. Jeffery Mulder</p>
                    <p class="sme">Subject Matter Expertise: Supernatural Anthropologist</p>
                    <h3 class="staffText">Bio:</h3>
                    <p class="staffText">Dr. Jeffery Mulder investigates the environmental and sociocultural impacts of anomalous phenomena, combining field anthropology with forensic and laboratory science. With degrees in Environmental Anthropology, Forensic Science, and Clinical Laboratory Science, his work focuses on detecting and analyzing ecological disturbances linked to reported anomalies.
                    <br>
                    Using particle detectors, UV imaging, and light metering, Dr. Mulder maps and catalogs affected sites to assess how unexplained forces interact with natural systems and human behavior. Though pragmatic in method and skeptical in outlook, he maintains a cautious respect for phenomena that continue to challenge scientific interpretation.</p>

                    <h3 class="staffText">Museum Role:</h3>
                    <p class="staffText">As MASO's Anomaly Impact Analyst, Dr. Mulder evaluates and documents the environmental, ecological, and human effects of anomalous phenomena. His research informs museum exhibits, safety protocols, and cross-disciplinary studies, providing critical insight into how anomalies interact with both ecosystems and human communities.</p>

                    <h3 class="staffText">Personal Mission:</h3>
                    <p class="staffText">"After witnessing my friend vanish under unexplained circumstances in the forest, I dedicated my life to studying anomalies. My research focuses on understanding their environmental, ecological, and human impacts—and on developing methods to protect people and ecosystems from potentially dangerous phenomena—using careful observation, rigorous science, and a cautious respect for the unknown."</p>

                    <p class="sme">Subject Matter Expertise: Supernatural Historian</p>
                    <h3 class="staffText">Bio:</h3>
                    <p class="staffText">Gavin Mercer combines a background in psychology with specialized training in Anomalous History, offering a unique perspective on the human experience of unexplained phenomena. After years as a therapist, he became fascinated by the consistent patterns in his patients' reports of supernatural encounters. This led him to pursue a master's degree in Anomalous History and join MASO, where he bridges historical research with public education.</p>

                    <h3 class="staffText">Museum Role:</h3>
                    <p class="staffText">As MASO's Supernatural Historian and Interpreter, Gavin researches historical accounts of anomalous and supernatural events, curates exhibits, and translates complex data into engaging, evidence-based displays for the public. He focuses on cultural context, societal impact, and psychological dimensions of the unexplained, helping visitors understand how human perception and history intersect with anomalous phenomena.</p>

                    <h3 class="staffText">Personal Mission:</h3>
                    <p class="staffText">"I became aware that the unexplained is not just in the events themselves, but in how people experience and record them. My mission is to study these occurrences with rigor, preserve their historical context, and communicate them in a way that is both educational and responsible. By understanding the stories behind the supernatural, I aim to help the public navigate these phenomena safely, with knowledge rather than fear."</p>

                    <h3 class="staffText">Interpretive Method</h3>
                    <p class="staffText">Gavin Mercer studies supernatural phenomena by listening to firsthand accounts, comparing global myths, and analyzing cultural context. For anomalies that can't be safely displayed, he creates detailed reconstructions and multimedia presentations that let visitors understand their nature and impact. His method emphasizes accuracy, immersion, and respect for the unknown, providing a realistic glimpse into the world of the unexplained.</p>

                    <p class="staffText">Laura Strathmore is MASO's archaeologist, specializing in the investigation and documentation of anomalous sites. She holds a B.A. in Archaeology, an M.Sc. in Archaeological Science, and a Ph.D. in Forensic Archaeology, combining rigorous field methods with advanced analytical techniques. Prior to joining MASO, Laura worked with several conventional museums, gaining extensive experience at excavation sites, artifact analysis, and preservation projects.
                    <br>
                    She is skilled in sampling, traditional and anomaly-focused photography, site mapping, and environmental documentation, using tools such as high-resolution cameras, spectral imaging equipment, and field surveying instruments. While she had never directly encountered supernatural phenomena before MASO, Laura's lifelong curiosity and her family's multigenerational stories of anomalous experiences inspired her to explore the unknown scientifically.</p>

                    <h3 class="staffText">Museum Role:</h3>
                    <p class="staffText">As the Archaeologist and Field Investigator, Laura conducts MASO's field research into anomalous sites and artifacts. She is responsible for planning and executing field expeditions, collecting and analyzing samples, and documenting environmental and material anomalies.
