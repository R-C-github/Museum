                <p class="description">Dedicated to the rigorous investigation of unexplained events, the Museum of Anomalies and Supernatural Occurrences serves as both a public exhibition space and a research institution. Its mission is to document, analyze, and interpret occurrences that fall outside conventional scientific understanding—from recorded apparitions and environmental anomalies to unexplained physical artifacts. Through interdisciplinary study, the museum seeks to expand the boundaries of empirical knowledge while maintaining a commitment to scientific integrity and critical inquiry.</p>

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p class="description">The Museum of Anomalies and Supernatural Occurrences (MASO) serves as the public extension of a long-standing research initiative originally established in the 1980s by a classified government division dedicated to the study of unexplained phenomena. While details of its early funding and operations remain partially redacted, MASO now operates as an independent institution committed to transparency, education, and scientific inquiry.</p>

                <h2>Grand Opening</h2>
                <p class="description">The museum opened its doors to the public in 2025, offering visitors a rare opportunity to examine declassified materials, field reports, and experimental data once limited to internal study. MASO stands at the intersection of skepticism and discovery—where evidence, mystery, and the pursuit of knowledge converge.</p>
